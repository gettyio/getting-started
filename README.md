#### Share to Care

Sharing is the right tool to allow others to absorb and share thoughts that will help to avoid the error others already faced or even get better chances to have a better coding with a few less or more lines or even chars of code.

#### Automating integrations and delivery (CI/CD)

A good way to not go crazy when the services grow on management is to automate repetitive tasks a operator would do manually, via terminal or a plataform. And again, a way to share knowledge bases for coders and operators fellas. Even better if it has an skeleton project to proove a concept of a deployment pipeline. Eg.: with AWS Amplify.

### CI/CD:

- [CircleCI](#circleci)

### Tech Stack

#### Languages used in Dev and Ops:

, an multiple-featured encryption tool based on GPG.

#### Infrastructure:
- CloudFormation (Infrastructure As Code for custom implementations)
- EC2
- EKS
- Lambda
- CloudFront
